# Python-Challenge

PyBank challenge:
I first asked the instructor if it was ok to use Pandas and Jupyter notebook for this module challenge and he stated that was fine as it was not listed in BootCamp Spot. Then I needed to figure out how to use the same notebooks we had in class that had smaller cells to test code. So I researched on Youtube to find out how to download those, downloaded the kernel notebooks and got started. I utilized many of the previous activities specially focusing on Pandas. I did google, and use chat GPT to assist in organizing my code base, specifically around the concept of 'shift(1)' we used a different method, but this one seemed to work well. I also searched on Stack overflow for answers. I did not copy and paste any code but did use the shift(1) concept.

PyPoll:
In this challenge I used a lot of the code from the PyBank code to analyze my results. I also used many modules from class to figure out hot to groupie and to use other functions on the data. I did utilize chatgpt to assist with idxmax, as my 'max()' was not yielding the needed results.
