PyBank and PyPoll Challenges
This repository contains the solutions for the PyBank and PyPoll challenges. These challenges were designed to test my skills with Python, specifically focusing on data manipulation and analysis using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.

PyBank Challenge
In the PyBank challenge, I was tasked with analyzing financial data to calculate key metrics such as profit/loss changes over a period, and the greatest increase and decrease in profit/losses. Here's an overview of the approach:

Instructor Approval: I initially asked the instructor if it was okay to use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, as they weren't listed in the BootCamp Spot, and received confirmation to use them.
Notebooks Setup: I researched on YouTube to figure out how to download the kernel notebooks used in class for testing smaller code cells, and successfully got the notebooks set up.
Data Manipulation: I applied previous activities and knowledge, particularly with Pandas, to process and analyze the data.
Shift(1) Method: I utilized the shift(1) method for data analysis, which I had to research on Google and Stack Overflow to understand how it worked. While a different method was initially suggested, shift(1) proved effective for this challenge.

PyPoll Challenge
For the PyPoll challenge, I analyzed election results to determine key statistics such as the total number of votes and the percentage of votes each candidate received. 
My approach included:

Leveraging PyBank Code: Many parts of the code from PyBank were used for PyPoll, as both challenges involved similar data analysis techniques.
Using groupby() and Other Functions: I utilized various functions such as groupby() to summarize and aggregate the election data.
Fixing idxmax() Issue: While working with the election data, I encountered an issue where the max() function was not yielding the desired results. I turned to ChatGPT for assistance and was guided to use the idxmax() function to retrieve the correct result.
Tools and Resources Used
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Jupyter Notebooks for coding and testing.
Stack Overflow for troubleshooting and problem-solving.
Google for research and clarification on various methods.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and Pandas installed in your environment.
Open the Jupyter Notebook for either the PyBank or PyPoll challenge.
Run the cells to analyze the financial and election data as described in the challenges.
Contribution
This project was developed using concepts learned in class and with assistance from ChatGPT, Google, and Stack Overflow. The final code was organized and structured through my own analysis and research to meet the objectives of each challenge.
